#What is a Joe minute? 

Backstory:
So, our friend Joe is typically late and our mission is to calculate the average of what a Joe minute is in real time to better estimate more accurately his arrival/call back time/repsonse time since that sometimes ranges from 1-3 minutes per 1 Joe minute to sometimes 30 minutes for 1 Joe minute

Must be able to add data to array per submission for each recorded Joe minute

Average array values and provide new average of a Joe minute in both hours and minutes for user to review after each submission

Must be able to calculate time between set time variables and calculate those minutes automatically
